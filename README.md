# Lapsed-Policies

This python code performs data analysis on excel sheets to segregate the policies to be revived to the particular agents/ authorities.   
It aims to reduce the manual work, and also reducing the time taken for doing so using classic Excel filters and all.     

It has been proven to function well in an organizational level.
